Prompt
~~~~~~

Suppose we discover a bug with our algorithm and investors for two deals had incorrect
allocations. This means that some of the investors ended up investing more than they were allowed to
while others invested less than they were allowed to. One of deals happened two years ago and the
other one happened two weeks ago. Please describe, in detail, how would you go about correcting this
issue and how would you communicate this to the affected customers.

Correcting the Issue

First, we would need to conduct a thorough investigation of the affected deals to understand the extent of the error. We'd need to identify which investors were over-allocated or under-allocated and by how much. Then, fix the bug in the allocation algorithm, implement rigorous testing to prevent similar issues in the future, and re-run the allocation process for both deals with the corrected algorithm to determine the accurate allocations. Working with legal and senior leadership, we could consider adjusting future distributions for those affected or offering credits to balance the over-allocations and compensate the under-allocated investors. Another option could be direct compensation.
